# K-Model using Penguin Dataset

K-means clustering is a powerful technique in data analysis used to group similar data points. 
In this Jupyter notebook, we explore the application of K-means clustering on a real dataset of 345 penguins. 
The objective is to determine if penguins of the same species exhibit different physical characteristics based on their sex.


## Introduction 

K-means clustering is a fundamental technique in unsupervised machine learning.
It allows us to group data points based on their similarity, which can reveal valuable insights in various domains, including biology.
In this notebook, I used a dataset of penguins to apply K-means clustering in order to identify patterns related to sex and species.

## Dataset 

The dataset used in this analysis contains information on 345 penguins.
It includes various physical characteristics and specifies their sex and species. 
The primary objective is to explore if penguins of the same species exhibit different physical characteristics based on their sex.

## Installation 
Notebook can be imported into Google Colab, VS Code, or uploaded to Jupyter Notebooks.
Make sure that dataset is properly targeted under Read_CSV. 

Feel free to experiment and have fun!
